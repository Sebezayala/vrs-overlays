## US Weather and Satellite Overlays and controls for Virtual Radar Server using Leaflet maps

This JavaScript code is a plugin for the ADSB aircraft tracking [Virtual Radar Server](http://www.virtualradarserver.co.uk) software using the default Open Street Maps maps. This application must be used with the Virtual Radar Server [Custom Content plugin](http://www.virtualradarserver.co.uk/Documentation/CustomContent/Default.aspx) version 2.x. It has not been tested with the beta 3.x system. 

This plugin is derived from the work of 'nitro999' and BoatrightTBC. You can see their overlay system at (https://github.com/nitro999/vrs-overlays) and (https://github.com/BoatrightTBC/vrs-overlays)
